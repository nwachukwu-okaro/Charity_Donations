# Charity Database Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing a charity's database to gain key insights that can help meet fundraising objectives for the upcoming year. The database contains two tables: 'donation data' and 'donors data', which, when merged, provide valuable information for analysis. The dataset consists of 1000 records and 15 attributes, including details such as state, ID, first name, last name, email, gender, job field, donor's state, donations, and donation frequency. Additional information about the donors is available in the 'donors data' dataset.

# Problem Questions
1. Highest and Lowest Donations by State: Determine which states contribute the highest and lowest donations. This analysis will help identify target areas for campaign efforts and prioritize fundraising strategies.

2. Contribution by Gender: Explore how different genders contribute to the charity. This analysis will provide insights into gender-specific patterns and preferences, enabling the design of more targeted and effective campaigns.

3. Donation Frequency: Analyze the frequency of donations from the donors. Understanding donation patterns and trends will help in planning fundraising activities and setting realistic targets.

4. Occupations Likely to Donate: Identify the occupations that are more likely to contribute to the charity. This information can be used to tailor messaging and outreach efforts towards specific professional groups.

5. Defaulters on Pledges to Donate: Determine which group of individuals are more likely to default on their pledge to donate. This analysis will help in implementing strategies to minimize defaults and maintain a strong donor base.

# Technologies Used
PostgresSQL: The queries written in this project utilize SQL to extract and analyze data from the charity's database.
Database: The project utilizes the charity's database, which includes the 'donation data' and 'donors data' tables.

# Conclusion
By analyzing the charity's database using SQL queries, this project aims to provide actionable insights for meeting fundraising objectives. The identified patterns and trends will assist in targeting specific regions, understanding gender-based preferences, determining optimal donation frequencies, tailoring messaging to specific occupations, and minimizing defaults. This analysis will support the charity in optimizing its fundraising efforts and achieving its goals.
